A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.
function multiplication(x,y){
return x*y}
multiplication(5,8)
Unit test:

Expect multiplication(5, 8) to be a number
Expect multiplication(5, 8) to be equal to 5
Expect multiplication("z", 8) to be an error
we expect multiplication
product= x*Y
return product

A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
Unit test:

Expect 2 arrays holding numbers in them exp. array1= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and array =[-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]
Expect concatOdds to output the result of the 2 arrays ([-3,-1,1,3,5,7,9,11,13])
Expect to use .length to get the full length of the arrays
Exepct concatOdds to have 2 parameters(param1,param2)
Expect a formula (num % 2=== 1) to return only odd numbers
Expect to have an empty array [] 
Expect .splice method to output only odd numbers into the empty array

Functional test

A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
